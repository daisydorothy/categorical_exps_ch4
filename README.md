# Categorical selection experiments (Ch4 of Style in Time)

* Five versions of a similar experiment; differences in the set of critical stimuli, their ordering and  randomization 

* `analysis` = analysis code (R) for experimental data
* `exp` = experimental code (Javascript/HTML/python) for running experiments with MTurk participants
  * participant data and multiple large files (brms models, AV material for experiments) are omitted from the repo due to participant privacy and size constraints
